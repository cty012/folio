## Chapter 3: The Journey Begins

For a week, Kael kept the compass hidden, taking it out only at night. He tested its limits, thinking of a specific book in the city library, a hidden alleyway from his childhood, the best bakery for sweet buns. Each time, the needle pointed true, a silent guide to the wants of his heart. The whisper he'd felt before was now a clear voice, and it was telling him to *go*.

Master Valerius would never understand. To him, the world was something to be captured and pinned down with ink and measurements. To leave that certainty behind was madness.

But Kael knew he couldn't stay. The compass was more than just a tool; it was an answer to a question he hadn't known he was asking. It was a promise of a world beyond the dusty workshop, beyond the predictable streets of Silverstream.

> To stay here is to be a copy of a copy. To leave... that is to draw a new map entirely.

The next morning, before the sun had risen, Kael packed a small bag with a loaf of bread, a waterskin, and a single, blank map. With the whispering compass held tight in his hand, he thought of his deepest, most secret desire: to find the edge of the world.

The needle spun, and with a decisive *click*, settled on a path leading out of the city gates. The journey had begun.

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main(int argc, int argv[]) {
    std::cout << "The journey begins!" << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```
