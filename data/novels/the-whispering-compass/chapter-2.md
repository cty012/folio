## Chapter 2: Secrets of the Compass

It was during a late-night inventory that Kael found it. Tucked away in a forgotten chest beneath a pile of sea charts was a small, unassuming compass. It wasn't made of polished brass or inlaid with mother-of-pearl. Its casing was dark, unadorned wood, and the glass was faintly scratched.

But when Kael picked it up, a strange warmth spread through his hand. The needle, cast from a metal that shimmered like captured starlight, didn't point north. It spun lazily, as if searching, before settling on a direction that pointed directly at Kael's own chest. He shook it. The needle trembled, then returned, pointing right at his heart.

### The Compass's Test

Confused, Kael decided to test the strange device. He set it on a workbench and performed a series of simple actions:

1.  He walked to the left of the bench. The needle followed him.
2.  He walked to the right. The needle tracked his every move.
3.  He held up a heavy iron ingot, expecting magnetic interference. The needle didn't waver.

This was no ordinary compass. It didn't point to a direction; it pointed to a *person*. Or, more specifically, it pointed to a desire. When Kael thought of the sea, the needle swung towards the window overlooking the port. When he thought of the mountains that loomed over the city, it swung east. It was a compass that led not to places, but to *truths*.
