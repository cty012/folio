## Chapter 1: The Mapmaker's Apprentice

The scent of old parchment and drying ink was the only world Kael had ever known. He was an apprentice in the dusty workshop of Master Valerius, the finest cartographer in the city of Silverstream. Every day was a meticulous routine of grinding pigments, trimming vellum, and copying the precise, elegant lines of his master's work.

Kael, however, yearned for more. He didn't want to just *copy* the world; he wanted to *see* it. He would stare at the maps of faraway lands, his fingers tracing the names of places he could only dream of.

The workshop was a chaotic treasure trove of the known world:
-   Rolled maps of the Sunken Isles, smelling faintly of salt.
-   Stacks of star charts, their constellations traced in silver ink.
-   Wooden drawers filled with surveying tools: sextants, astrolabes, and compasses of every make.

Master Valerius, a man whose back was as bent as the rivers he drew, often chided Kael for his daydreaming.

> "A map is a promise, boy," he'd rasp, his voice like stones grinding together. "It promises that the world is knowable. Orderly. Don't go chasing the parts that aren't."

But Kael couldn't help it. He felt a pull towards the blank edges of the parchment, the places marked **Here Be Dragons**. It was a pull he didn't understand, a whisper on the edge of his hearing.
